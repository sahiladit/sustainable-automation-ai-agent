# **Sustainable Automation AI Agent**  
🚀 **An AI-powered decision-making system for optimizing IoT energy consumption**  

## **📌 Overview**  
The **Sustainable Automation AI Agent** is an **AI-driven decision-making system** that optimizes **IoT device power consumption**. It analyzes **historical efficiency, real-time energy usage, and usage frequency** to determine whether an IoT device should be:  
- **Turned off**  
- **Kept on**  
- **Reduced in intensity (if applicable)**  

Unlike traditional **machine learning models**, this system **uses a pre-trained AI agent**, eliminating the need for continuous retraining. It provides **real-time energy-saving decisions**, helping reduce **electricity wastage in smart homes, industries, and IoT-enabled environments**.

## **🔧 Features**  
✔ **AI-Powered Decision Making** – Determines the optimal power state (ON/OFF/Adjust).  
✔ **Energy Efficiency Score (EES) Calculation** – Computes **EES based on power usage, frequency, and historical efficiency**.  
✔ **Real-Time Monitoring** – Processes **live IoT energy consumption**.  
✔ **Daily & Yearly Energy Savings Estimation** – Predicts potential **energy savings**.  
✔ **Pre-Trained AI Agent** – No **continuous training required**, ensuring **low computational overhead**.  
✔ **Scalable & Modular** – Works for **individual IoT devices and large-scale industrial systems**.
