Sustainable Automation AI Agent
🚀 An AI-powered decision-making system for optimizing IoT energy consumption

📌 Overview
The Sustainable Automation AI Agent is an advanced AI-driven system designed to intelligently manage IoT device power consumption. By analyzing historical efficiency, usage frequency, and real-time energy data, the agent determines whether an IoT device should be turned off, remain on, or reduce its intensity to optimize energy efficiency.

This AI agent operates using a pre-trained decision model that eliminates the need for continuous training, making it computationally efficient and deployable in smart homes, industries, and IoT networks.

🔧 Features
✔ AI-powered Decision Making – Determines the optimal energy state (ON/OFF/Adjust) for IoT devices.
✔ Energy Efficiency Score (EES) Calculation – Computes EES based on historical efficiency, power consumption, and usage frequency.
✔ Real-time Energy Monitoring – Processes live energy consumption data.
✔ Daily & Yearly Energy Savings Estimation – Provides insights into potential energy savings.
✔ Pre-trained AI Model – No continuous training required, ensuring efficiency.
✔ Scalable & Modular – Works for individual IoT devices as well as large-scale industrial networks.
